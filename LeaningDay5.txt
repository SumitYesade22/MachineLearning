Regression metrics

mean absolute error
mean squared error
root mean squared error
r2score=1-sum of squared error in the regression line/sum of squared error in the mean line
if score is 0.80 then we can say that the independent feature is able to explain the 80% of the variance of the output feature

adjusted r2 score
some of the extra feature tend to add more to r2score even if they are irrelevant 

linear regression
multiple regression
gradient descent-optimization algorithm 
                 batch descent(whole data for slope calc)
                 stociastic(just one row at a time)
                 mini batch(batches of data)
