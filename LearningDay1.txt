Day 1 of learning ML

Instance Based Learning-No model training just storing training data and then whenever the predictions is to be made the neighbouring points are checked and then the predictions are made ,for eg k means .no generalization
Model Based Learning- model is trained and generalization is brought to predictions, the data isnt stored

Challenges in Machine Learning

Insufficient data
overfitting
poor data
biased data
irrelevent features
underfitting
costs

Tensors
0D - 1 ( single number)
1D/vector - {1,2,3,4,5}
2D/Matrices
