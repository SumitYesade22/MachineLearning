Columnar tranformation
despite of applying ohe for nominal variabless on separate column , ordinal encoder for separate column, label encoder for 
separate column and then merging it , we use column tranformation where a function that includes a list of transformers which is lists of tuples
including the techniques , names and lists of columns 

Machine Learning Pipelines
here we create a pipeline of all the transformation with the ml model and then fit a data into it , this reduces the extraload of tranforming
the input data of the model when the model is exported and used anywhere else.

tansform function for normal distribution
log tranform - use when the data is right skewed
x square- use when the data is left skewed
reciprocal
